# drasyl Nodes as Finite State Machines

This example demonstrates how drasyl nodes can be implemented as finite state machines using
the [dining philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem).

Start the example by
typing `mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.drasyl.example.diningphilosophers.DiningPhilosophers"`
. In the output you can see the actions of the philosopher nodes.
