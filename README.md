drasyl is a general-purpose overlay network framework for rapid development of distributed P2P applications.

By using drasyl developers can fully concentrate on creating distributed applications.
With drasyl boundaries between layer-2 networks will be eliminated and secure communication channels between any peers will be provided.
Zero-configuration is required to use drasyl.
Developers can run a new drasyl node without having to write configuration files or provide IP addresses of peers.

_As drasyl is primarily developed for the research project
[Smart Networks for Urban Participation (SANE)](https://sane.city/) and focuses on functionalities necessary for the project. However, drasyl is open to
contributions made by the community._

    @Override
    public void onEvent(Event event) {
        // handle incoming events (messages) here
        System.out.println("Event received: " + event);
    }
};
node.start();

// wait till NodeOnlineEvent has been received

// send message to another node
node.send("0229041b273dd5ee1c2bef2d77ae17dbd00d2f0a2e939e22d42ef1c4bf05147ea9", "Hello World");
